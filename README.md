# Quality Muncher Go
Quality Muncher Go (aka QM:GO) is a program written to make low quality videos, images, GIFs, and audios.

## Usage
Download the file as a zip, extract and open then run `go run main.go -i "your input.mp4" -p 5 -o "your output.mp4"`

#### Flags
Input: `-i yourfile.mp4`
Output: `-o output.mp4`
Quality preset: `-p <number 1-7>`
Framerate: `-fps <number>`
Scale: `-s <fraction>`

## Builds
Build your own, I barely know how to and can't be bothered until this is actually somewhat usable.

## Disclaimer
This is barely functional and still VERY much in the alpha stages of development.
